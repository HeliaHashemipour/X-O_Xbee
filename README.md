# Introduction

In this project, we are going to design a platform with the help of Xbee module, Keypad and Arduino board and some LEDs in the score mode of LCD (platform) to recite players with memorization. Social network distance to play with X-O.

***Project goals:***
- Learning to work with the Xbee module
- Writing code in Arduino
- Connecting two or more (for scoring mode) Arduino board to each other
- Connecting Arduino to Keypad and coding using Keypad.h library
- Simulation of connecting two virtual connection ports (COM) to each other to simulate control modules Remotely in Proteus
